Integrating OSC with oF for Games
Category: advanced specialist chapter

Introduction:
This chapter explains how OSC can be implemented in openFrameworks, allowing developers to enable wireless communication between multimedia devices for real-time control. The project in this chapter is a game for 2 players, controlled by two OSC-enabled devices (e.g. smartphones with OSC apps). Player 1 uses their controller to manipulate their on-screen avatar; Player 2 uses their controller to add difficulty to the game (adding enemies, manipulating speeds, etc.). OSC is a useful tool for any oF developer interested in being able to remotely control their appâ€™s properties (visuals, sounds, etc.) without having to build their own custom controller.
