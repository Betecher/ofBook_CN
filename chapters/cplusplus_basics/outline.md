# what my chapter looks like so far

+ bird's eye view of programming
	+ warning about material being cumulative
	+ programming is an iterative cycle
	+ compiling helloworld on ideone.com
	+ code is in a fixed-width font, this book uses fonts to denote code vs. prose
+ deconstructing the helloworld piece by piece
	+ commenting out code
	+ pre-processor directives
	+ compiler errors
	+ namespaces
	+ functions
		+ calling them
		+ arguments
		+ return
		+ defining your own
	+ encapsulation of complexity
		+ high level vs. low level

+ social history
	+ origin from Bell Labs, timing, intentions
	+ modern role of C++ amongst other languages
	+ C versus C++ and Why did C become C++?
	+ other flavors of C, and why they exist.
	+ C versus other languages
		+ note to self: don't bash java
+ Variables I
	+ counting example
	+ fundamental math operators ( + - * / )

+ conditionals
	+ Syntactic Sugar
	+ Inequality Operators
	+ Boolean Logic

+ while loop
	+ break
	+ continue
+ for loop
	+ break
	+ continue

+ returning early from a function

# things i still need to talk about





    
+ Variables II
	+ some basic data types (int, char, float)
	
	+ computer science operators
		+  modulo
		+ bitwise math
			+ interlude about how `cout` overloads `<<`
		+ boolean logic
	+ some less basic data types (unsigned, double, long, short)
	+ converting between these data types
	

+ memory addressing
	+ arrays
	+ stack vs. heap
	+ dynamic allocation
	+ pointers
+ header files
+ abstraction
	+ structs
	+ classes
		+ private
		+ public
		+ inheritance?
+ std::string
+ other STL?
+ possibly show them local terminal-based C++ in cygwin/linux/bsd
+ possibly weave in basic GLUT/OpenGL to make this all more fun?

+ learning C++ "for real" (book recommendations)
