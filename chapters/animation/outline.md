Animation
=========

note this will be loosely based on this class / code
https://github.com/ofZach/algo2012

- brief notes about animation and movement
- central question: how can we make things move in a lifelike and compelling way?
- animation in OF basics: 
    - frame rate
    - update and render loop
    - point object
- variables for movement
    - pct based animation
    - linear interpolation 0-1, 
    - easing functions, powf
    - zeno
- sin / cos based movement
- simulation
    - vector vs point (and disambiguate with std::vector)
    - particles system
    - attraction repulsion
    - vector field
- noise
- where to go further
    - more complex forces (ie: springs)
    - mixing forces (ie: flocking)
    - libraries (ie: box2d)
