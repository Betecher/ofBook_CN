Rough Outlines-- What we have so far
=========


Here are the rough outlines altogether so you can see them as one. This is not a place for comments-- just a place 
to get an overall picture of where you're all headed. To comment, you've all agreed on github/issues so everyone 
should stick with that 

As Zach pointed out in an email, questions to think about:
a) Does the scope of the outline look right?  Is it too broad or too narrow?
b) Is this outline detailed enough (some look a bit on the thin side, might be helpful to try to expand more)
c) Are there any massive overlaps that look wrong?   
d) Are there any gaps?  
e) Does the ordering look right, where should the case studies fit?

Image_Processing_Computer_Vision (Golan)
=========


##1. Introduction 

[This outline is based on workshops Golan taught with Kyle.]
Some previous reference materials here:
-- http://futuretheater.net/wiki/Vision_Workshop
-- http://piratepad.net/resonate-cv 
-- http://www.flong.com/texts/essays/essay_cvad/

Unedited copy-paste from Arturo email (not yet integrated):
looks great to me, something i always find useful to explain as introduction in CV workshops before going into software details is the differences between contour finding (manual input sessions / delicate baoundaries) / motion detection (memo's gold / damian's wind) / blob tracking (chris o'shea's audience) and how contour finding *usually* gives more "precise" information than motion detection while it requires a much more controlled environment (ie: lighting) and how blob tracking techniques are usually some combination of contour finding + motion detection. all of it seems to be in the different subsections of your outline, i find it useful to explain it as an introduction with examples so people get a general idea but perhaps for the book is better to explain it along with the different techniques
also explaining the physical setup of such installations, IR lighting, filters... how to make the computer see some things and humans others and in general how all the work you can do in the physical setup will make your live easier when coding: the first time zach explained to me how in mesa di voce the screen is flooded with IR so the computer has to do almost nothing in order to detect the performers, it totally changed my way of thinking about this kind of problems

Integrating OSC with oF for Games
Category: advanced specialist chapter

Introduction:
This chapter explains how OSC can be implemented in openFrameworks, allowing developers to enable wireless communication between multimedia devices for real-time control. The project in this chapter is a game for 2 players, controlled by two OSC-enabled devices (e.g. smartphones with OSC apps). Player 1 uses their controller to manipulate their on-screen avatar; Player 2 uses their controller to add difficulty to the game (adding enemies, manipulating speeds, etc.). OSC is a useful tool for any oF developer interested in being able to remotely control their app’s properties (visuals, sounds, etc.) without having to build their own custom controller.

Terms:

●        OSC
●        Routing
●        IP addresses/ports


###Outline

●        Historical overview of OSC
●        Overview in general of how OSC works
●        OSC apps for smartphones/tablets
●        Setting up OSC
●        Types of messages
●        How routing messages works
●        Implement P1 controls
●        Implement P2 controls
●        Other projects made with OSC/further resources

Introduction_to_version_control_with_git (Christoph)
=========
 

*This chapter will give a high-level overview over a pretty complex topic with a generous amount of links to more material to enable readers to easily find appropriate information. It's quite difficult to do it in anything approaching completeness in only a couple of pages, and a high-level overview  will be more useful to the reader.*

### What is version control, and why should you use it?

* VCS versus manual methods (e.g. backups in named folders)
* Which problems are avoided?
* Enables management of larger projects and/or collaboration in teams
* Popular systems and their major differences

### Introduction to Git
* What is Git? 
* How does it work? 
    - *short crash-course with generous links to deeper reading*
    - *KISS! this will be the major challenge considering Git's complexity*
    - introduce following terms:
        - repositories
        - commits&immutability
        - branches
        - merging, merge conflicts(!)
        - gitignore
        - remotes, push&pull.
        - ...
* Most often used commands and features
* List of popular GUI clients

### Github
* What is it?
* How does it work? What can it do for you: Pull requests, issue trackers, collaboration
* openFrameworks on Github. 
* Your project(s) on Github

### Conclusion

* Where do you go from here? More complex & powerful VCS mechanisms out there (git flow, branching workflows,...)
* Where/how do you get help if things go wrong? (Stack Overflow, Git homepage, google, OF forum category "revision control")
* (more tools?)

#Intro_to_Graphics (Mike)

###Programming Graphics
Personal goals for chapter:

* Explain the basics in a way so as to not lose anyone who is just picking up programming
* Explain ways for thinking about generating visuals algorithmically 
* Demonstrate some ways to get your work off of your computer and into the interwebs
* (Hopefully) include interesting things for those who are more advanced

####Section 1: Simple Graphics Loop
* __Intent:__ Get comfortable the update/draw, background and 'foregrounds'
* __Project:__ Drawing a simple shapes at the mouse position  
  * Explain XY pixel coordinate system
  * Clearing the screen using background
  * Circle/Rect/Ellipse/Line (and ofSetRectMode)
  * Fill and stroke concepts in openFrameworks
  * Drawing multiple shapes, drawing order
  * Turning off auto background and using transparency for trail effect 
    * If not covered in a previous chapter, effects of framerate


####Section 2: Procedural Colors
* __Intent:__ Explain ofColor and ways to explore colors procedurally (using recursion).  Also, parameter searching.
* __Project:__ Explore the HSB way of thinking by making color compositions 
  * Explain the ways color can be specified (grayscale, RGB, RGBA, HSB)
  * Using HSB dimensions to generate color palettes
    * Why not RGB?
    * Concept of recursion
    * Subdivide screen into smaller rectangles that change slowly along one of the HSB color dimensions
      * Example images: [hue](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/20_intro_to_graphics/EvolvingColor_ChangingHue.png), [saturation](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/20_intro_to_graphics/EvolvingColor_ChangingSaturation.png), [brightness](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/20_intro_to_graphics/EvolvingColor_ChangingBrightness.png)
      * Uses ofRect, ofRectangle, ofRandom and std::vector
    * Defining controllable parameters 
      * Parameter searching interactively using mouseX, mouseY and key presses
* __Extension:__ Documenting your work (part 1)
  * Static work, saving an image (PNG or PDF)
    * Workarounds to make ofSaveScreen() work with ofSetBackgroundAuto(false) using ofImage
    * Saving images at a higher resolution than screen?
  * Moving work, saving a gif
    * Best for short animations, like here where we can show the process of the colors evolving in the recursion
    * Saving a series of images and compositing them 
    * Possibly a section on ofxGifEncoder
    * Tips for compression
  
####Section 3: Coordinate Systems Transformations
* __Intent:__ Explain power of moving coordinate system
* __Project:__ Trippy animated spiralling rectangles
  * Explain the 'moving the paper' analogy
  * Concept of repetition
  * Drawing expanding and sprialling rectangles
    * Same rectangle code, ofRect(0, 0, w, h) 
    * Visual changes comes from ofRotate, ofScale, ofTranslate
    * Makes use of ofNoise for creating sprialling rotations
  * [Example image](https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/20_intro_to_graphics/CoordSystem_RepeatingSquareSpiral.png)

####Section 4: The Other Shapes
* __Intent:__ Finish off 2D graphics using curves, beziers, and custom shape
* __Project:__ Not yet sure what will go here...
 * Teach in the context of a project with generative visuals, like:
  * Cellular automata, like Conway's Game of Life
  * Dynamic drawing brushes
  * Using a movie or image to drive the creation of shapes
* __Extension:__ Documenting your work (part 2)
  * Sometimes a gif doesn't cut it, saving a movie
   * ofxVideoRecorder (doesn't work on windows, so I can only really link to it)
    * For interactive works, 3rd party recording software
    * For noninteractive works, creating a 'rendering' mode, saving frames and stiching them together using ffmpeg or openFrameworks

####Section 5: Meshes
* This is pushing the limits of what can fit in a chapter, but I'd love to see coverage of 3D and meshes in the book...
* __Intent:__ Jump into meshes, cameras, and thinking about ways to generate meshes
* __Project:__ I could attempt to shorten up the [generative mesh tutorial](http://openframeworks.cc/tutorials/graphics/generativemesh.html) and include it
 * Basics of meshes
   * Modes, indicies, vertices
 * One way to think about creating a generative mesh
   * Loading image, getting pixels, using them as source data
    * Applying rules to the data to generate vertices and connections
 * ofEasyCam to navigate
 * How to handle the mesh to create simple animation and interactivity

####Section 6: Links to Addons and Where to Learn More
* Addons
  * Adding Physics
    * ofxBullet
    * ofxBox2d
  * Computer Vision
    * ofxCv or ofxOpenCv
  * Vector Graphics
    * ofxSVG or ofxVectorGraphics
* Additional Resources
  * I'll sort this out in more detail once I have an idea of what the other chapters in the book will look like 
  * ofBook will already have computer vision and shaders, so I'd like to point to resources on particle systems, opengl, vector math, and whatever else fits. 
  * Links to cool openFrameworks projects

    - optimizing: replace video with opengl-animation
    - investigate: ofLogToFile with dynamic date
    - investigate: monitor process times for operations to find the bottleneck

Project_Memo
=========

##0. intro
- what this chapter is, and what it isn't.
- what you should know before reading this.
- Not indepth coverage of any one topic, but covering each topic very briefly, to show how many different topics can come together to create an app
- summary of what we will create (Body Paint, Gold, Reincarnation, Depeche Mode Fragile Tension, U2 PUNK), areas we will cover, and how everything fits together

##1. Video Input
- loading video files (ofVideoPlayer)
- reading live webcam input (ofVideoInput)
- How to write the app in a way to seamlessly switch between taking input from VideoPlayer (i.e. a file) vs Webcam Input (i.e. live)
- OOP / Polymorphism allows ofBaseVideo
- pro tips

##2. Basic Image Processing + Computer Vision
####Create particle-creation-map:
- frame differencing
- threshold (binary, top, bottom)
- adaptive threshold
- blur, median
- morphology (erode, dilate, open, close)

##Optical flow (to advect fluid simulation)
- blur
- threshold

##Misc
- align input image to desired position in output: image transforms
- pro tips

#3. Fluid simulation
- non-core addons
- github
- advect fluid with optical flow
- pro tips
     
#4. Particles 
##Behaviours:
- create with particle-creation-map
- basic dynamics (F=ma, v = u + at)
- vector math (arithmetic, normalising, cross products, dot products etc.)
- gravity, wind, mass, drag, momentum, noisefields, mapping curves, adding variance, sparkles, etc.
- pro tips

##Drawing
- manually (easy way, old fashioned and slow)
- Vertex Array (vs VBO)
- ofMesh
- Vertex Shader?
- pro tips


#5. Post FX (optional)?
 - fbo
 - fragment shader?
 - pro tips
